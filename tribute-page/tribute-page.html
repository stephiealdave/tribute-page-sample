			<p id="intro">George Gordon Byron is my most favorite British poet I had ever known. I spent my childhood to early teenage years reading thick literature books that is why I knew him. Long time ago, I chose him to be my main topic for a school project. I found it enjoyable, to type his poems stanza by stanza though it's long. Among his poems, <em>She Walks in Beauty</em> is what I like the most.</p>
			<p id="poem">
			She walks in beauty, like the night <br>
			Of cloudless climes and starry skies; <br> 
			And all that’s best of dark and bright <br>
			Meet in her aspect and her eyes; <br>
			Thus mellowed to that tender light <br>
			Which heaven to gaudy day denies. <br><br>

			One shade the more, one ray the less, <br>
			Had half impaired the nameless grace <br>
			Which waves in every raven tress, <br>
			Or softly lightens o’er her face; <br>
			Where thoughts serenely sweet express, <br> 
			How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. <br><br>

			And on that cheek, and o’er that brow, <br>
			So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, <br>
			The smiles that win, the tints that glow, <br> 
			But tell of days in goodness spent, <br>
			A mind at peace with all below, <br>
			A heart whose love is innocent!
